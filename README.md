## About this project:
<p>While working on this project, I learned that you can use JavaScript to create an embedded object and get the time from it using built-in functions. This is great because it eliminates the need for additional libraries.</p>
<p>I also learned how to create a SetInterval function. It is used to constantly call another function. In this project it was necessary: to make sure that the time was correctly updated.</p>
